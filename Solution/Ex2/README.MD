# Countdown Timer Project

Welcome to the Countdown Timer project! In this project, you will create a simple countdown timer web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will help you understand the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and timer functions in JavaScript.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to create your Countdown Timer:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Inside the project directory, create the following files:
   - `index.html`
   - `index.css`
   - `index.js`

### Step 2: HTML Structure

In the `index.html` file, set up the HTML structure for your countdown timer web application. You will need the following elements:

- A container `<div>` with a class of `timer`.
- Inside the container `<div>`, create two nested `<div>` elements with classes `timer__controls` and `display`.
- Within the `timer__controls` `<div>`, create buttons for predefined timer durations (e.g., 20 Secs, Work 5, Quick 15, etc.) and a form with an input field for custom timer duration.
- Inside the `display` `<div>`, create elements to display the time left and the end time.

### Step 3: CSS Styling

In the `index.css` file, add CSS styles to customize the appearance of your countdown timer web application. You can style the buttons, input field, timer display, and other elements to match your design preferences.

### Step 4: JavaScript Logic

In the `index.js` file, write JavaScript code to implement the countdown timer functionality. You'll need to define functions to start the timer, update the timer display, and handle user input for custom timers. Additionally, you'll need event listeners to respond to button clicks and form submissions.

### Step 5: Test Your Countdown Timer

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to test your countdown timer web application. Try starting predefined timers and setting custom timers to ensure everything works as expected.

### Step 6: Customize and Extend

Feel free to customize and extend your countdown timer project further. You can add features like sound notifications when the timer ends, visual effects, or additional timer options. Be creative and have fun with your project!
